If you have worked with Next.js you know that there are many things it helps to make your life easier. The 'Layout' component was a heavy hitter for me when I first started working in Next.js. It allowed me to have a single component that I could use to wrap all of my pages. This was great for things like a header, footer, or any other components that I wanted to be on every page. However, there are times when you want to exclude your header, footer, or whatever other components that you can shed. This is where the 'getLayout' function comes in. Let's discuss it in this article and see come code of this functionality in action.

## The Situation

You are using next-auth and you wanted to make a custom sign in page. Unfortunately, the sign in page is wrapped in the 'Layout' component. This means that you have to sign in to see the sign in page. This is not ideal. You want to be able to see the sign in page without being signed in. This is where the 'getLayout' function comes in.

## Options

Hide the div on your normal layout.

## Solution

The solution is to add a 'getLayout' function to your sign in page. This function will return the page component wrapped in whatever you want. In this case, we want to return the page component without the 'Layout' component. This is a great way to have a single component that you can use to wrap all of your pages. This was great for things like a header, footer, or any other components that I wanted to be on every page. However, there are times when you want to exclude your header, footer, or whatever other components that you can shed. This is where the 'getLayout' function comes in. Let's discuss it in this article and see come code of this functionality in action.
