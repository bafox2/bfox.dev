# Per Page Layouts in Nextjs

If you have worked with Next.js you know that there are many things it helps to make your life easier. The 'Layout' component was a heavy hitter for me when I first started working in Next.js. It allowed me to have a single component that I could use to wrap all of my pages. This was great for things like a header, footer, or any other components that I wanted to be on every page. However, there are times when you want to exclude your header, footer, or whatever other components that you can shed. This is where the 'getLayout' function comes in. Let's discuss it in this article and see come code of this functionality in action.

## The Situation

You are using next-auth and you wanted to make a custom sign in page. Unfortunately, the sign in page is wrapped in the 'Layout' component. Your user is now seeing the header with the login, which might be what you want, but it probably is not. Depending on your UI setup, it might be clutter, and modern design style does not include a header. This is no good. Let's do some coding.

## Options

We are going to consider a few options before we talk about the solution we are going with. We want to respect DRY principles and we will favor a declarative solution over an imperative one. With that said, let's look at three options.

### Good old CSS

Our first attempt at the solution is probably the most simple, but ultimately, this isn't going to be what we choose.

```
/* Login.module.css */
header {
  display: none;
}
footer {
  display: none;
}
```

This would probably work with your setup, but it isn't extensible, and we don't want to waste any computational resources on generating a DOM object, even if they are relatively inexpensive.

### Using the Router in our .\_app file

Next.js is wonderful and one of the wonderful this about it is the router object.

```
//pages/._app.tsx
function MyApp({ Component, pageProps, ...appProps }: AppProps) {

    const isLayoutNeeded = [`/dashboard`].includes(appProps.router.pathname)
    const LayoutComponent = isLayoutNeeded ? Layout : <></>;

    return (<ApplicationWrapper>
      <LayoutComponent>
          <Component />
      </LayoutCompnent>
    </ApplicationWrapper>);
}
```

You would have '/login' instead of '/dashboard', or whatever page you were wanting to change. The ternary returns the layout, or a fragment, and the return statement gives your component. This isn't the most extensible option, so we are going to skip.

### Using .getLayout

Our hero of the day is .getLayout. It requires a little setup, but it lets us define what type of layout we want in the page itself.

```
// pages/index.tsx
import type { ReactElement } from 'react'
import Layout from '../components/layout'
import type { NextPageWithLayout } from './_app'

const Login: NextPageWithLayout = () => {
  return <p>log in</p>
}

Login.getLayout = function getLayout(page: ReactElement) {
  return (
    <Layout>
      {page}
    </Layout>
  )
}

export default Page
```

This is the pattern that we will use on each specific page. We import the layout(s) we want to use, and put them on the page. We have a one time setup in out .\_app page that we need to include.

```
// pages/_app.tsx
import type { ReactElement, ReactNode } from 'react'
import type { NextPage } from 'next'
import type { AppProps } from 'next/app'

export type NextPageWithLayout<P = {}, IP = P> = NextPage<P, IP> & {
  getLayout?: (page: ReactElement) => ReactNode
}

type AppPropsWithLayout = AppProps & {
  Component: NextPageWithLayout
}

export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppPropsWithLayout) {
  // Use the layout defined at the page level, if available
  const getLayout = Component.getLayout ?? ((page) => page)

  return getLayout(<Component {...pageProps} />)
}
```

Here are the types to modify our .\_app and use the layout. After this, we don't need to go back to this file for layouts. We have our solution.

## Docs

Next.js has a great documentation page on this topic. You can find it [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/layouts#per-page-layouts) and explore all the features to your nerd heart's content.

## Edge Cases

When using the pattern we defined above, the edge cases can be handled using nested layouts. A good concept to explore to dig deeper into React is [higher order components](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html). Read up!

## Conclusion

The 'getLayout' function is a function that you can add to your page components. This function will be called in your pages/.\_app and will look for a layout defined in your specific page. This solution is great because it keeps the code 'in-house' to the page when trying to define the what it is. I hope that this was easy to follow and helpful.
