## Intro

For the first post of my feed, explaining how the way I left teaching feels correct. Compared to what I want to share, this will be more sentimental, fluffy, and starry-eyed, because that's how I feel about my time teaching.

I decided to become a teacher in my senior year of college at Virginia Tech, and after I met with the program coordinator, I called my ma crying from the emotional flood. In high school, I took teachers for tomorrow, but I did it for the GPA boost, not because of some deeper reason. After I spent time in a first-grade class, teaching the concept of rounding numbers for an hour, I found a new fascination. How complicated is 0-4, round down; 5-9, round up? Apparently, very, very, complicated. This was personified by a student whose sister was an old friend. She didn't get it for so long until she did. That was great.

The last five years were delightful. I look back with love. Herndon was great. The town is special, for many reasons, but mostly for the people. I loved the administration, coworkers, and student body. It was hard to have a bad day when you were surrounded by people who generally like what is going on. I hope that I can have that again in life.

Not that I have the most extensive job history, but teaching had a range of emotions available on any given day. You didn't know what was going to happen on any given day, or how students would react to the news of the day.

## What I will miss

School is the most important thing. I used to think it was education that is the most important thing, but changing 'education' to 'school' feels more real to me after my experience. Not everyone is going to take away a world-class education from their school, but they may take away something to be cherished as they move into adulthood.

Selfishly, I am going to miss the excuse to dive into different cultures in a true-to-myself way. Once again, Herndon is awesome for this. In my day to day, I learned about Salvadoran, Russian, Bengali, and so many other cultures. Since I taught English Language Learner classes, I picked up on the languages of my students in an authentic way.

Succinctly putting into words how good the feeling of knowing an impact was positively made on a kid, is hard. In personal finance, there are some surprisingly slow lessons. Despite my love for compound interest, I struggled to open up the portal to let students into the wonderful world of MathMagic through exponential growth. Daniel was a senior who was already working, passing the class easily, and always honest about how my class had gone that day. After the lesson was over and he finished the work, he let me know that the class was a 'miss' for the day. Hurt, but understanding, I tried again to express how amazing it is that given the average growth rate for the S&P index, we ALL could become millionaires by the time we are 60, by contributing around $600. This time, through the power of proximity, he told me that he agreed that's pretty amazing and that I should try explaining it again to the class, "but do it like that" so that the class could get it. I tried, but it didn't resonate for the rest like the speech had done for Daniel.

## What I will not miss

Anyone with a job can tell you their least favorite things about that job. To correctly portray this snapshot of my thoughts, it's necessary to include what my least favorite things were. First, the grades-over-everything mentality is exhausting for teachers. Looking back to my days as a student, I was the same way, but I wish it didn't have to be like that. Can I retake this? Is this going to be graded? Can I see what my grade will be if I don't do this? Is this going on in the first quarter or the second? I feel it in my bones still. On a related note, the battle over whether integrity matters is heated in the classroom. A student doesn't usually see education as a toolbox for life, but as a weeklong slog to make it to Friday afternoon without getting yelled at. It doesn't matter if they cheat as long as they make it through the week. My impact in the classroom hopefully mitigated that aspect of educational culture, but it's hard to fight against the tide.

## What I hope to lose

I want to shake off the feeling that education determines worth. As a teacher, I know that I made sure to impart the value of education to students, but I think I convinced myself that it is too big of a component in the nebulous calculation of how I thought of someone. Writing this out feels silly, because it should have always been obvious, but I lost sight of what I thought was valuable. Education is powerful as a tool, but it does not mean that a person is kind, or good.

## What I hope to gain

In changing, there are a few things I look forward to adding to my life. The first is geographic mobility. Although there are schools anywhere there are people, it's hard to leave northern Virginia because teachers here are treated so well. Teaching is hard, but it isn't hard in the same type of way that I've found coding to be. I used to come in two hours early in my first year to touch up lesson planning, but even after those 2 hours, it was still unclear whether or not the lesson was 'improved'. Getting a feature to work after troubleshooting is elation in a way that lesson planning was not.

## Conclusion

Some of my friends have said that they plan on becoming a teacher later on in their careers after they have accomplished everything in their field. I see the reason in that, yet I think there is something special about how students respond to someone who has some familiarity with 'youth' culture. I've loved my time in school and I have things to take with me for the rest of my life. Thanks, Herndon, I am indebted forever.
